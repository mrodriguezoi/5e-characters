                ancient forests or in silvery spires glittering with faerie light, where soft music drifts through the
                air and gentle fragrances waft on the breeze. Elves love nature and magic, art and artistry, music and

                When alliances between humans and orcs are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise
                to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc
                rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other more civilized races.
                Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their
                barbaric customs and savage fury.

                To be greeted with stares and whispers, to suffer violence and insult on the street, to see mistrust and
                fear in every eye: this is the lot of the tiefling. And to twist the knife, tieflings know that this is
                because a pact struck generations ago infused the essence of Asmodeus, overlord of the Nine Hells (and
                many of the other powerful devils serving under him) into their bloodline. Their appearance and their
                nature are not their fault but the result of an ancient sin, for which they and their children and their
                children's children will always be held accountable.
